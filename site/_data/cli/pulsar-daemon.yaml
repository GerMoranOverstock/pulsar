  A wrapper around the [`pulsar`](#pulsar) tool that's used to start and stop processes, such as ZooKeeper, bookies, and Pulsar brokers, in the background using [nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup).

  argument: service
  options:
  - flags: -force
    description: Stop the service forcefully if not stopped by normal shutdown.
