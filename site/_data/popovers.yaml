ack:
  q: What is an acknowledgement (ack)?
  def: A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed.
bookie:

bookkeeper:
  q: What is BookKeeper?
  def: Apache BookKeeper is a persistent log storage system that Pulsar uses to store message data.
broker:
  q: What is a broker?
  def:
    "A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers."
cluster:
  q: What is a cluster?
  def: A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies). Clusters can reside in different geographical regions and replicate messages to one another in a process called geo-replication.
consumer:
  q: What is a consumer?
  def: A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers.
cursor:
  q: What is a cursor?
  def: The subscription position for a consumer.
discovery:
  q: What is discovery in Pulsar?
  def: TODO
dispatcher:
  q: What is a dispatcher?
  def: An asynchronous TCP server used for all data transfers in a Pulsar cluster. The Pulsar dispatcher uses a custom binary protocol for all communications.
geo-replication:
  q: What is geo-replication?
  def: TODO
global-topic:
  q: What is a global topic?
  def: A topic that belongs to a global, instance-wide namespace and thus isn't tied to any specific cluster.
global-zookeeper:
  q: What is global ZooKeeper?
  def: "A ZooKeeper cluster that Pulsar uses for instance-wide, rather than cluster-specific, tasks."
instance:
  q: What is a Pulsar instance?
  def: A group of Pulsar clusters that act together as a single unit.

standalone:
  q: What is a standalone Pulsar broker?
  def: A lightweight Pulsar broker in which all components run in a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM) process. Standalone clusters can be run on a single machine and are useful for development purposes.

zookeeper:
  q: What is ZooKeeper?
  def: |
    ZooKeeper is a service that Pulsar uses for coordination-related tasks.<br /><br />A Pulsar instance relies on both a local ZooKeeper for cluster-specific tasks and a global ZooKeeper for instance-wide tasks.
